# Movie Recommender MLOps Project

This project is an end-to-end MLOps demo that trains a movie recommendation model on MovieLens dataset,
deploys it as a FastAPI service, and automates CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions and Codespaces.

## Structure

- `data/` - Sample data files
- `src/` - Source code for model training, prediction API, and utilities
- `.github/workflows/` - GitHub Actions workflows for CI/CD
- `.devcontainer/` - Configuration for GitHub Codespaces development environment

## How to run

1. Open the project in GitHub Codespaces.
2. The dependencies auto-install.
3. Run `python src/train.py` to train the model.
4. Run `python src/predict.py` to start the API.
5. Use the `/recommend` endpoint to get movie recommendations.
